%RAND Uniformly distributed pseudorandom numbers.
%   R = RAND(N) returns an N-by-N matrix containing pseudorandom values drawn
%   from the standard uniform distribution on the open interval(0,1).  RAND(M,N)
%   or RAND([M,N]) returns an M-by-N matrix.  RAND(M,N,P,...) or
%   RAND([M,N,P,...]) returns an M-by-N-by-P-by-... array.  RAND returns a
%   scalar.  RAND(SIZE(A)) returns an array the same size as A.
%
%   Note: The size inputs M, N, P, ... should be nonnegative integers.
%   Negative integers are treated as 0.
%
%   R = RAND(..., CLASSNAME) returns an array of uniform values of the 
%   specified class. CLASSNAME can be 'double' or 'single'.
%
%   R = RAND(..., 'like', Y) returns an array of uniform values of the 
%   same class as Y.
%
%   The sequence of numbers produced by RAND is determined by the settings of
%   the uniform random number generator that underlies RAND, RANDI, and RANDN.
%   Control that shared random number generator using RNG.
%
%   Examples:
%
%      Example 1: Generate values from the uniform distribution on the
%      interval [a, b].
%         r = a + (b-a).*rand(100,1);
%
%      Example 2: Use the RANDI function, instead of RAND, to generate
%      integer values from the uniform distribution on the set 1:100.
%         r = randi(100,1,5);
%
%      Example 3: Reset the random number generator used by RAND, RANDI, and
%      RANDN to its default startup settings, so that RAND produces the same
%      random numbers as if you restarted MATLAB.
%         rng('default')
%         rand(1,5)
%
%      Example 4: Save the settings for the random number generator used by
%      RAND, RANDI, and RANDN, generate 5 values from RAND, restore the
%      settings, and repeat those values.
%         s = rng
%         u1 = rand(1,5)
%         rng(s);
%         u2 = rand(1,5) % contains exactly the same values as u1
%
%      Example 5: Reinitialize the random number generator used by RAND,
%      RANDI, and RANDN with a seed based on the current time.  RAND will
%      return different values each time you do this.  NOTE: It is usually
%      not necessary to do this more than once per MATLAB session.
%         rng('shuffle');
%         rand(1,5)
%
%   See <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '\techdoc\math\math.map'],'update_random_number_generator')">Updating Your Random Number Generator Syntax</a> to use RNG to replace
%   RAND with the 'seed', 'state', or 'twister' inputs.
